  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

  <p>Tee Box Network ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Tee Box Network mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App. Please read this policy carefully. If you disagree with its terms, please discontinue use of the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>We do not collect precise GPS or real-time location data. Location is limited to the city you choose to share in your profile.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage your account</li>
    <li>Enable you to connect with other golfers</li>
    <li>Facilitate messaging between users</li>

    <li>Monitor and analyze usage patterns to improve the App</li>
    <li>Detect and prevent fraudulent or abusive activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With other users:</strong> Profile information you make public (name, photo, bio, golf stats, city) is visible to other users of the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use third-party services including Supabase (database and authentication) and Google Firebase (push notifications). These providers only process your data as necessary to provide their services.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, court order, or governmental authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase, which employs industry-standard encryption and security practices. Profile photos are stored in secure cloud storage. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>6. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>We use Google Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications. You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings. Disabling notifications will not affect your ability to use the App.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 18, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 18, please contact us.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
